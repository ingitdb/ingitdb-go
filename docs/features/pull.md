# inGitDB Pull

`ingitdb pull` is a single command that performs a complete pull cycle for an inGitDB database.

## Status

Pending (Phase 3).

## What it does

1. **Pulls latest changes** from the remote via `git pull --rebase` (or `--merge`).
2. **Auto-resolves generated file conflicts** — materialized views and `README.md` files are regenerated rather than manually merged.
3. **Resolves data file conflicts interactively** — opens the field-by-field TUI for any source record files that have conflicts requiring a human decision.
4. **Rebuilds materialized views and README.md** if the incoming changes affect them.
5. **Prints a change summary** listing every record added, updated, or deleted by the pull.

## Why

Running `git pull` + `ingitdb resolve` + `ingitdb materialize` manually is repetitive and error-prone. `ingitdb pull` automates the full cycle in one command.

## CLI

```
ingitdb pull [--path=PATH] [--strategy=rebase|merge] [--remote=REMOTE] [--branch=BRANCH]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--path=PATH` | Path to the database directory. Defaults to the current working directory. |
| `--strategy=rebase\|merge` | Git pull strategy. Default: `rebase`. |
| `--remote=REMOTE` | Remote to pull from. Default: `origin`. |
| `--branch=BRANCH` | Branch to pull. Default: the current branch's tracking branch. |

See [CLI reference](../CLI.md#pull--pull-latest-changes-resolve-conflicts-and-rebuild-views-not-yet-implemented).

## Change summary format
