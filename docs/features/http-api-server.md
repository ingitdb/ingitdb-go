# HTTP API Server

## Status

Pending (Phase 7).

## Description

An OpenAPI-compatible HTTP server that exposes inGitDB collections over a REST interface.
CRUD endpoints are schema-driven: request and response bodies are validated against the collection definition.

GraphQL support is tracked separately (Phase 8).
