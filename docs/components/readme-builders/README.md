# inGitDB Readme Builder

The `README.md` is a built-in specialized implementation of [materilized views](../../features/materialized-views.md).

The `inGitDB` CLI can create and update `README.md` for colections and collection records
following rules defined in `.ingitdb-collection.yaml` definition file.

This is used to creates nice human and AI readable summaries about collections and records.

The collections `README.md` can show list or table of records (either all or sorted and limited).
