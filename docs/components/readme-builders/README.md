# 📘 inGitDB README Builder

The `README.md` is a built-in specialized implementation of [materialized views](../../features/materialized-views.md).

The `inGitDB` CLI can create and update `README.md` for collections and collection records
following rules defined in the `.ingitdb-collection.yaml` definition file.

This is used to create human- and AI-readable summaries about collections and records.

A collection's `README.md` can show a list or table of records (all records, or sorted and limited).
