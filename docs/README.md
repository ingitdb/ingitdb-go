# 📘 inGitDB Documentation

inGitDB turns a Git repository into a schema-validated, queryable database where every record is
a plain YAML or JSON file. There is no server to run and no binary format to decode — the data
lives in files you can read, edit, and diff with any text editor or git client. Git itself
provides the history, branching, and merge story for free. If that sounds like the right
trade-off for your project, read on — and consider contributing.

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

The diagram below shows the write path: a CLI command loads the database definition, validates
records, rebuilds materialized views, and leaves every change as a normal git commit.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([ingitdb CLI]) --> B[validator.ReadDefinition]
    B --> C{Schema valid?}
    C -- yes --> D[DataValidator\nwalks $records/]
    C -- no --> E([Exit 1 — schema error])
    D --> F{Data valid?}
    F -- no --> G([Exit 1 — data errors])
    F -- yes --> H[ViewsBuilder\ngenerates $views/]
    H --> I[(Git repository\non disk)]
```

The same Git repository is also exposed to AI agents via an MCP server (Phase 6), and to any
Go program through the [DALgo](https://github.com/dal-go/dalgo) abstraction layer implemented
in `pkg/dalgo2ingitdb`.

## 🤝 Get Involved

The best way to understand inGitDB is to point it at a directory of YAML files and run
`ingitdb validate`. From there, check the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) to see what is being built and
the [Backlog](BACKLOG.md) for tasks that are ready to be picked up.

To contribute:

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the pull-request workflow.
2. Read [CODING_STANDARDS.md](CODING_STANDARDS.md) before writing any Go.
3. Open or comment on an [issue](https://github.com/ingitdb/ingitdb-cli/issues) to discuss your
   idea before investing time in a large change.

Bug reports, documentation improvements, and questions are all welcome. The project is small
enough that every contribution makes a visible difference.
