# 📘 inGitDB Configuration

# 📘 User config - `~/.ingitdb/.ingitdb-user.yaml`

List inGitDB often open by user – used to improve user experience in the interactive mode.
This is not required as `ingitdb` CLI will autodetect repository config when started in a dir under Git repo.

# 📘 Repository config

At the root of the repository you should have a `.ingitdb.yaml` file that defines:

- [root_collections](root-collections.md)
- [languages](languages.md)

Each collection directory contains an `.ingitdb-collection.yaml` file:

- [collection-definition](collection-definition.md)
