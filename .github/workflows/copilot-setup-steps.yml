name: "Copilot Setup Steps"
# This workflow runs before the GitHub Copilot coding agent executes.
# It installs dependencies required by the ingitdb MCP server so that
# `go run ./cmd/ingitdb serve --mcp` works inside the agent environment.
# See .github/copilot/mcp.json for the MCP server configuration that must
# be pasted into Repository Settings → Copilot → Coding agent.
